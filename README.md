# Fluid-Mechanics-Wind-Tunnel-Construction-Project

As part of my Fluid Mechanics-II course, I designed and constructed a wind tunnel for aerodynamic visualization and analysis. The tunnel is engineered to accommodate a wide range of test models, from simple geometric shapes to airfoils, vehicle bodies, and architectural structures, enabling a comprehensive study of aerodynamic behavior.

A key feature of this wind tunnel is its flow visualization capability, allowing for the observation of boundary layer development, flow separation, vortex formation, and wake structures. This is achieved using smoke injection and other visualization techniques, providing clear insights into flow dynamics around different objects.

The wind tunnel ensures controlled and uniform airflow within the test section, minimizing turbulence and enhancing the accuracy of qualitative and quantitative aerodynamic assessments. Its modular design allows for future enhancements, such as integrating force measurement systems and pressure sensors for advanced aerodynamic studies.

This project serves as a foundational platform for experimental fluid mechanics, supporting both aerodynamic research and educational demonstrations, bridging the gap between theoretical concepts and real-world applications.
